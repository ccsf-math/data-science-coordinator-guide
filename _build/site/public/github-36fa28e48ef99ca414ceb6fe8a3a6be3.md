# GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a web-based platform for hosting files in repositories, collaborating on projects, and tracking changes to files over time. It uses Git, an open-source version control system, to manage and track changes. We use GitHub to organize the materials, user access, conversations, and issue tracking for all the content and people associated with our relevant courses and programs. This resource contains all of the information on our GitHub configuration.

### Organizations

[Organizations](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations) are shared accounts where we can collaborate across many projects at once. Our organizations are:

- [ccsf-math](https://github.com/orgs/ccsf-math-108): For all non-course-specific projects under the Mathematics Department
- [ccsf-math-108](https://github.com/orgs/ccsf-math-108): For all of the MATH 108 materials and staff

### Repositories

[Repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories) contain all of the code, files, and each file's revision history. We can discuss and manage our work within the repository.

### Projects

We use [GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects) to organize the release and development of course materials each semester and to host conversations about updates, clarifications, and issues.

#### Project Setup
1. Create a [new project](https://github.com/orgs/ccsf-math-108/projects) with the naming scheme of "`SEMESTER` `YEAR` Materials" (i.e. "Fall 2025 Materials")
