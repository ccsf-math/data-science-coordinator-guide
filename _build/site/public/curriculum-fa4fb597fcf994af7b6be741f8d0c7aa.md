# Curriculum

## Responsibility
The Data Science coordinator collaborates with the department chair, curriculum committee, and other college stakeholders to develop and modify new and existing Data Science curriculum.

---

## Overview
Our current curriculum focuses on the Data Science AS degree, the Data Analytics Certificate, and the core courses supporting these programs.

---

## General Tasks
- Browse program sites and [ASSIST.org](https://assist.org/) for related courses and programs at neighboring colleges.
- Identify articulation agreement opportunities for MATH 108 and other courses we develop.

## More Details

### Program Development
The Computer Science Department hosted a Data Science certificate for several years before the creation of MATH 108. With the arrival of MATH 108, CS updated their certificate, renamed it to Data Analytics, and made MATH 108 a required course. 

Shortly after, the Mathematics Department developed the Data Science AS degree. To accommodate students with existing statistics and programming experience, the degree allows MATH 108 **OR** ((STAT C100 OR LALS 5 OR PSYC 5 OR ECON 5) AND CS 110A). Initially, the degree included a domain emphasis course, but this was removed to reduce the total units. 

The remaining requirements—Calculus I and II, Linear Algebra, Programming Fundamentals, and Data Structures & Algorithms—align with courses found in regional university data-related programs. We should continue monitoring potential changes to the Calculus sequence and the development of alternative mathematics requirements at UCs/CSUs. Depending on how the units for STAT C100 are finalized, we may also need to revisit our statistics and probability requirements. Significant grant work is underway across the state to define and standardize Data Science programs.

### Course Development
The only course developed specifically for our degree so far is MATH 108, closely modeled after UC Berkeley’s DATA 8. There have been discussions about creating a more accessible noncredit data course similar to UC Berkeley’s DATA 6. 

There is also student demand for a course beyond MATH 108. While UC Berkeley’s DATA 100 (which requires Linear Algebra) could be an ideal follow-up, it is considered upper division and is therefore not transferable. For now, our focus remains on MATH 108 while exploring the development of a noncredit orientation course and possibly a noncredit topics course on machine learning or AI as part of a certificate.
