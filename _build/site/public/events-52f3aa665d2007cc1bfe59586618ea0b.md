## Overview
Over the past few years, we have hosted several speakers to share their data-related work with students and the broader CCSF community. These talks are designed to give attendees insight into how data is used across various industries.

The format has been virtual, with each speaker joining via Zoom to give a ~30-minute talk about their background and current work. Each event concludes with a Q&A session. Recordings of these events are available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fu1vBo0HR3Y&list=PLDHNuYFn2lPMa-arWNI5XIONq2i-JfWN-).

As of Fall 2025, we’ve received new funding to support a general **Mathematics Speaker Series** and will be transitioning away from a Data Science–specific focus.

## General Tasks
- The Data Science Coordinator should help identify and recommend potential speakers for the series to the Department Chair or the faculty member overseeing the Speaker Series.
- Assist in advertising the talks to students and faculty.
- Maintain an archive of past talks or ensure they are available on Shawn Wiggins’s CCSF YouTube channel.
