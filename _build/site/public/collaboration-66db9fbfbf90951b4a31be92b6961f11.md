# Collaboration

## Responsibility
The Data Science coordinator seeks to build relationships with other departments, creating opportunities for students to apply their new Data Science skills in courses they take in other disciplines, thereby deeply enriching the student experience.

## Overview
Our vision around developing MATH 108 included the update of research methods courses in the sciences. Computer Science has modified their curriculum to include MATH 108 as a requirement in their Data Analytics certificate, and they generally accept MATH 108 as an alternative to their CS 110A course. We've had positive conversations with several other departments, but we have not observed any curriculum change that utilizes the content from MATH 108.

## General Tasks
- Reach out to other departments to see how we can support their program(s).

## More Details

### Computer Science
We have worked pretty closely with {term}`Jonathan Potter` as we've grown our program. The [Data Analytics Fundamentals Certificate of Achievement](https://www.ccsf.edu/degrees-certificates/data-analytics) is hosted in the Computer Science department. When they revised that certificate, they included MATH 108 as a required course. Since we have students who take MATH 108 after CS 110A, we've worked with {term}`Craig Persiko` to modify our MATH 108 content to consider students who have introductory Python experience.

### Behavioral Sciences
We've had conversations with {term}`Rebecca Ancheta` about trying to integrate the MATH 108 student skills into PSYC 2 and SOC 21, where students complete projects in a research methods course.
