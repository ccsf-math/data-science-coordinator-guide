# Communication

## Responsibility
The Data Science coordinator gives regular reports at Math department meetings. These updates keep our faculty knowledgeable of the growing program and our relationships with institutions such as the relationship we have with Berkeley City College, Laney College, UC Berkeley, and UC Merced where we are focusing on improving transfer pathways for Data Science.

---

## Overview
During the Mathematics Department meetings, there are usually 5-10 minute time slots for coordinators to update the department on their work. For the Data Science Coordinator, we have been informing the department about any training opportunities, grant updates/developments, upcoming events, and general updates about the program.

### Data Science Grand Challenge
Through the California Learning Lab's Data Science Grant Challenge, we are involved with the [Building Inclusive and Collaborative Foundations in Data Science](https://calearninglab.org/project/building-inclusive-and-collaborative-foundations-in-data-science/) grant. In partnership with Berkeley City College, Laney College, UC Berkeley, and UC Merced, this grant supports our tutoring, faculty training, and transfer pathway development. {term}`Katia Fuchs` is the CCSF PI and {term}`Shawn Wiggins` is the CCSF Co-PI for this grant.

### Training for Foundations of Data Science
MATH 108 is an adaptation of UC Berkeley's DATA 8 course. To support faculty in deciding whether to teach MATH 108, we’ve created a Canvas shell — [Training for Foundations of Data Science](https://ccsf.instructure.com/courses/61235) — which includes the unmodified Spring 2022 version of DATA 8. Because most instructors likely did not take a course like MATH 108 during their own schooling, this shell offers a self-paced opportunity to experience the course as it was originally taught at Berkeley. While instructors will still need to learn the specifics of our CCSF version, this resource provides foundational context from the course’s originators, allowing faculty to reflect on our local adaptations and bring their own perspective to the material.

## General Tasks

- Provide a short update about all things related to our Data Science program at the department meetings.
- Field questions and mark assignments as Complete for faculty and staff participating in the Training for Foundations of Data Science shell.
