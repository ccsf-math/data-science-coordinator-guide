# Projects

We use [GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects) to organize the release and development of course materials each semester and to host conversations about updates, clarifications, and issues.

## Project Setup Workflow

Before the start of the semester: 

1. Create a [new project](https://github.com/orgs/ccsf-math-108/projects) using the naming scheme "`SEMESTER` `YEAR` Materials" (e.g., "Fall 2025 Materials"). This project will host all the items for the semester, and we can limit the view of the items and details based on the role of the individuals in the organization. This allows those with full access to see all the items and conversations, while limiting the view for those who don't have or need full access.
1. Add the `Milestone` and `Repository` [fields](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/understanding-fields) to project.
1. Change the name of the view to Weekly Release.
1. Update layout of the project view and group by Milestone.
1. Create [Milestones](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones) within each relevant repository. These milestones allow us to group related items so we can focus on what needs to be done for the upcoming release of materials. For example, create a milestone called "Week 01 Release" with a due date of August 15, 2025 in the `materials-fa25-staff` repository.
