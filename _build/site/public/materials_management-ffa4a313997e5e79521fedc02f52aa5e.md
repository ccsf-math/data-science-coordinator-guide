For context, this page is assuming that you are working with our JupyterHub. With a few modifications, this guide will support working offline from your own computer. Additionally, this guide will reference the Fall 2025. Make appropriate updates for other semesters.

### Clone Repositories

For the semester you are working on, you want to make sure that you have a clone of the `materials`, `materials-fa25-staff`, and `materials-fa25` repositories. With your main folder, you should have the following structure:

```{code-block} text
📂 /
├── 📂 materials/
│   ├── 📄 raw.csv
│   └── 📄 processed.csv
├── 📂 notebooks/
│   └── 📄 analysis.ipynb
└── 📂 src/
    ├── 📄 main.py
    └── 📄 utils.py
```




### Editing a Notebook

1. Open or create the notebook you want to edit in the [`materials` repository].
