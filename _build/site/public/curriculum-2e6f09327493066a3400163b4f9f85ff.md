# Curriculum

## Responsibility
The Data Science coordinator works with the department chair, the department curriculum committee, and other college stakeholders to participate in the development and modification of new and existing Data Science curriculum.

## Overview
Our curriculum work currently revolves around a Data Science AS degree, a Data Analytics Certificate, and the core courses involved with the programs.

### Program Development
The Computer Science Department hosted a Data Science certificate for a few years before the development of MATH 108. With the arrival of that course, CS updated heir certificate and renamed it as Data Analytics. They made MATH 108 a required course for that certificate. Shortly after that, we developed the Data Science AS degree in MATH. To accommodate students with statistics and programming experience already, we set up the degree to accept MATH 108 OR ((STAT C100 OR LALS 5 OR PSYC 5 OR ECON 5) AND CS 110A). Initially, the degree included a domain emphasis course, but we removed it to reduce the units. The rest of the degree consists of the courses (Calculus I and II, Linear Algebra, Programming Fundamentals, Data Structures and Algorithms) we felt regional universities were using in their data-related programs. We should keep an eye on the (potential) redesign of the Calculus sequence or the development of an alternative Calculus/Mathematics requirement at UCs/CSUs. There is a lot of grant work being done around the state to try and formalize what Data Science is.

### Course Development
The only course developed for our degree program so far has been MATH 108, which more or less mirrors DATA 8 at Berkeley. There has been talks about developing a more approachable non credit data course such as DATA 6 at Berkeley. Also, there is student demand for a course after MATH 108. DATA 100 at Berkeley (which requires Linear Algebra) would be a nice choice, but it is not transferable since it is considered upper division. For the meantime, we are focusing on MATH 108 and exploring the non credit orientation course and potentially a non credit topics course on machine learning/AI.
