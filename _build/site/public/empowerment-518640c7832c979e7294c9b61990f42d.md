# Empowerment

## Responsibility
The Data Science coordinator runs a Data Science community for both faculty teaching data science and students who are currently taking the course. Part of the role of that community is to empower new faculty to teach the course and to empower students who passed the course successfully to mentor and support students who are taking the course currently.

## Overview
MATH 108 is an adaptation of UC Berkeley's DATA 8 course. We have worked with Berkeley's [DATA 8 adoption team](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/dsus/educationalpartners/data8-adoption) over the last few years as we've worked to localize our version of the course as MATH 108.
