For context, this page is assuming that you are working with our JupyterHub. With a few modifications, this guide will support working offline from your own computer. Additionally, this guide will reference the Fall 2025. Make appropriate updates for other semesters.

### Clone Repositories

For the semester you are working on, you want to make sure that you have a clone of the `materials`, `materials-fa25-staff`, and `materials-fa25` repositories. With your main folder, you should have the following structure:

```{code-block} text
ðŸ“‚ /
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ materials/
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ materials-fa25-staff/
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ materials-fa25/
```




### Editing a Notebook

1. Open or create the notebook you want to edit in the [`materials` repository].
