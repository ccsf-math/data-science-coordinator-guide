# Data Science Coordinator Guide

## GitHub

We use GitHub to organize the materials, user access, conversations, and issue tracking for all the content and people associated with our Data Science courses and programs. 

### Organizations

GitHub [organizations](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations) are shared accounts where we can collaborate across many projects at once.

- [ccsf-math](https://github.com/orgs/ccsf-math-108): The organization for all the related projects under the Mathematics department
- [ccsf-math-108](https://github.com/orgs/ccsf-math-108): The organization for MATH 108 which includes all the materials and staff

### Projects
