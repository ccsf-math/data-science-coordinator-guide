For context, this page is assuming that you are working with our JupyterHub. With a few modifications, this guide will support working offline from your own computer. Additionally, this guide will reference the Fall 2025. Make appropriate updates for other semesters.

### Clone Repositories

For the semester you are working on, you want to make sure that you have a clone of the `materials`, `materials-fa25-staff`, and `materials-fa25` repositories. 

With your main folder, you should have the following structure:

```{code-block} text
/
├── materials/
├── materials-fa25-staff/
└── materials-fa25/
```

If any of these folders are missing (e.g. `materials-fa25`), you can create them with the contents from GitHub by running the following in a terminal:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/ccsf-math-108/materials-fa25.git
```




### Editing a Notebook

1. Open or create the notebook you want to edit in the [`materials` repository].
