# Support

## Responsibility
The Data Science coordinator organizes specific tutoring opportunities for MATH 108 students. Since MATH 108 is such a new course, we usually need to provide additional support for our tutors and establish alternative tutoring opportunities in order to provide a similar level of tutoring for our MATH 108 students that the rest of our students in the Department experience.

## Overview
We believe that a key feature of Berkeley's success with DATA 8 was the extensive support system for their students. Every since the beginning of MATH 108, we've tried to build up a support network for the course. 

### Math Lab Tutors

### Data Ambassadors
Through a Learning Grant, we have supported remote tutoring and mentoring through our Data Ambassadors program. The program originally featured UC Berkeley students who where seeking a Data Science degree and were former Community College students. These students offered virtual homework support and mentorship. Over the years, we have worked to include CCSF students as Data Ambassadors, and we've expanded the program to include Laney and Berkeley City College. 

Kseniya has been the main organizer for this program. She is part of hiring the ambassadors at Berkeley and coordinating their availability with the needs of the participating colleges. The Data Science Coordinator has worked with Kseniya to set up the mentorship/tutoring schedule, ensure the Ambassadors have access to the relevant materials/sample solutions, and distributed that information to students, faculty, and staff at CCSF.

#### GitHub Access
- For any tutor, we need to make sure that they have a GitHub account, have access to our JupyterHub, have access to the `materials-xxXX-staff` repository, and are part of the appropriate Support team [Data Ambassadors](https://github.com/orgs/ccsf-math-108/teams/data-ambassadors) or [Math Lab Tutors](https://github.com/orgs/ccsf-math-108/teams/math-lab-tutors). This allows them to see the discussion about the materials and access sample solutions for tutoring.
- If the tutor does not have a mail.ccsf.edu Google account, we need to message their Google email addresses to Sean so they can login. The berkeley.edu domain is associated with a Google account.
- The tutors need to authenticate their GitHub accounts on our JupyterHub. The general process is:
    1. Invite the Ambassador (by their GitHub username) to the `ccsf-math-108` GitHub organization and put them in the Data Ambassador team
    1. Have the Ambassador [open a terminal](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/terminal.html) in our hub
    1. Type the command `gh auth login`
    1. Follow all the prompts and accepting the default response for each prompt
    1. Copying the provided one-time code and pasting it at https://github.com/login/device
