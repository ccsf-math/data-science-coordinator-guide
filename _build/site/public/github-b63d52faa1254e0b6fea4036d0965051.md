# GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a web-based platform for hosting files in repositories, collaborating on projects, and tracking changes to files over time. It uses Git, an open-source version control system, to manage and track changes. We use GitHub to organize the materials, user access, conversations, and issue tracking for all the content and people associated with our relevant courses and programs. This resource contains all of the information on our GitHub configuration.
