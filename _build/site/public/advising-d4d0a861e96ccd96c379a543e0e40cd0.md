# Advising

## Responsibility
The Data Science coordinator maintains a list of students who are well on their way to the Data Science AS and connects with them regularly to make sure they are getting what they need in terms of advising, encouragement, and mentorship. This is designed to close the loop on completions &mdash; avoiding students dropping out of the program for lack of support.
