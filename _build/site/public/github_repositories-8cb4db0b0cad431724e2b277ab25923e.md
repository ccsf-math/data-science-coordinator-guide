# Repositories

[Repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories) contain all of the code, files, and each file's revision history. We can discuss and manage our work within the repository. There are several repositories within our organizations, here are the main repositories for the **Fall 2025** semester:
