# Infrastructure

## Responsibility
The Data Science coordinator maintains the technology needed to run MATH 108.

## Overview
We utilize various technologies to provide students, faculty, and staff with interactive notebooks for lectures and assignments. The Data Science coordinator should work with {term}`Sean Morris` and {term}`Shawn Wiggins` to make sure the JupyterHub is set up before the start of the semester and continue to be in communication with them about updates and issues.
