# Communication

## Responsibility
The Data Science coordinator gives regular reports at Math department meetings. These updates keep our faculty knowledgeable of the growing program and our relationships with institutions such as the relationship we have with Berkeley City College, Laney College, UC Berkeley, and UC Merced where we are focusing on improving transfer pathways for Data Science.

## Overview

### Department Meetings
During the Mathematics Department meetings, there are usually 5-10 minute time slots for coordinators to update the department on their work. For the Data Science Coordinator, we have been informing the department about any training opportunities, grant updates/developments, upcoming events, and general updates about the program.
