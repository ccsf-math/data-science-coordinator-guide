## Responsibility
_The Data Science coordinator recruits speakers from the Data Science industry for the Math Department speaker series, bringing in speakers from a variety of professional fields to describe how they use Data Science in their professions._

---

## Overview
Over the past few years, we have hosted several speakers to share their data-related work with students and the broader CCSF community. These talks are designed to give attendees insight into how data is used across various industries.

The format has been virtual, with each speaker joining via Zoom to give a ~30-minute talk about their background and current work. Each event concludes with a Q&A session. Recordings of these events are available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fu1vBo0HR3Y&list=PLDHNuYFn2lPMa-arWNI5XIONq2i-JfWN-).

As of Fall 2025, we’ve received new funding to support a general **Mathematics Speaker Series** and will be transitioning away from a Data Science–specific focus.
