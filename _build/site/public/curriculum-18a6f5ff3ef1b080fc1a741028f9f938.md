# Curriculum

## Responsibility
The Data Science Coordinator works with the department chair, the department curriculum committee, and other college stakeholders to participate in the development and modification of new and existing Data Science curriculum.

---

## Overview
Our curriculum work currently revolves around:
- The **Data Science AS degree**
- The **Data Analytics Certificate**
- The core courses supporting these programs

---

## General Tasks
- Browse program sites and [ASSIST.org](https://assist.org/) for related courses and programs at neighboring colleges.
- Seek articulation agreement opportunities for MATH 108 and other courses we develop.

## More Details

### Program Development
- **Background:** The Computer Science Department originally hosted a Data Science certificate.  
  After MATH 108 was developed, CS updated *their* certificate, renamed it **Data Analytics**, and made MATH 108 a required course.
- **Degree Creation:** Shortly after, the Mathematics Department developed the **Data Science AS degree**.  
  - To accommodate students with existing statistics and programming experience, the degree accepts:  
    `MATH 108` **OR**  
    `((STAT C100 OR LALS 5 OR PSYC 5 OR ECON 5) AND CS 110A)`.
  - Initially included a domain emphasis course, which was later removed to reduce total units.
  - Remaining requirements align with regional university expectations for data-related programs:  
    Calculus I & II, Linear Algebra, Programming Fundamentals, Data Structures & Algorithms.
- **Ongoing Considerations:**
  - Monitor potential UC/CSU redesign of the Calculus sequence or alternative math requirements.
  - Depending on how the units for STAT C100 are finalized, we may need to revisit our statistics/probability requirement.
  - Stay informed on statewide grant initiatives aimed at formalizing Data Science curriculum standards.

### Course Development
- **Current Course:**  
  - **MATH 108** — Mirrors UC Berkeley’s DATA 8.  
- **Possible Future Courses:**  
  - A more approachable *noncredit* Data Science course, modeled after Berkeley’s DATA 6.  
  - A post-MATH 108 course. DATA 100 at Berkeley (requires Linear Algebra) would be ideal content-wise but is upper-division and not transferable.  
  - A *noncredit* orientation course.  
  - A *noncredit* topics course on machine learning/AI for a certificate pathway.
