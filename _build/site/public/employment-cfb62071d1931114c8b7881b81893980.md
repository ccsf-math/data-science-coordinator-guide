# Employment

## Relevant Responsibilities

## Contacts
- Emily Burns: erburns@ccsf.edu

## Overview
We have been working with Emily Burns in [Career Services](https://www.ccsf.edu/academics/career-education/career-services-office) to connect our students with internships and other employment opportunities within data-related fields. 

- Primarily, Emily has been emailing us with a list of resources she has gathered, and then the coordinator contacts current students in related courses and programs and those on the [Data Science List](#data_science_list).
- We made some progress with SFMTA to try and establish an internship that would connect with our MATH 108 course, but that develop stopped when our main contact at SFMTA took on a new role.

We continue to seek out opportunities for our students. In particular, we want to establish internships for students who successfully complete MATH 108, the Data Analytics Certificate, or the Data Science AS degree to help strengthen the utility of those classes and programs.
