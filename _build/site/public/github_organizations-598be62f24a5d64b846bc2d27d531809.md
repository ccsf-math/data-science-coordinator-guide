# Organizations

[Organizations](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations) are shared accounts where we can collaborate across many projects at once. Our organizations are:

- [ccsf-math](https://github.com/orgs/ccsf-math-108): For all non-course-specific projects under the Mathematics Department
- [ccsf-math-108](https://github.com/orgs/ccsf-math-108): For all of the MATH 108 materials and staff
