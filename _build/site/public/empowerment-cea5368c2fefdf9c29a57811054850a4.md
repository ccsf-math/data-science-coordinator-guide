# Empowerment

## Responsibility
The Data Science coordinator runs a Data Science community for both faculty teaching data science and students who are currently taking the course. Part of the role of that community is to empower new faculty to teach the course and to empower students who passed the course successfully to mentor and support students who are taking the course currently.

## Overview

### Faculty Training
MATH 108 is an adaptation of UC Berkeley's DATA 8 course. Over the past few years, we have collaborated with Berkeley’s [DATA 8 adoption team](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/dsus/educationalpartners/data8-adoption) to localize the course for CCSF. Eric, Kseniya, and Sean have been the main contacts for us at Berkeley. Eric and Kseniya have helped with the adoption process and navigating the course materials while Sean has helped with the technology details for running MATH 108. 

To support faculty in deciding whether to teach MATH 108, we’ve created a Canvas shell — [Training for Foundations of Data Science](https://ccsf.instructure.com/courses/61235) — which includes the unmodified Spring 2022 version of DATA 8. Because most instructors likely did not take a course like MATH 108 during their own schooling, this shell offers a self-paced opportunity to experience the course as it was originally taught at Berkeley. While instructors will still need to learn the specifics of our CCSF version, this resource provides foundational context from the course’s originators, allowing faculty to reflect on our local adaptations and bring their own perspective to the material.

### Data Science Email List

We have maintained an email list, primarily made up of former MATH 108 students. Periodically, we send out updates about the program, and we share employment opportunities such as internships and tutoring positions with the Math Lab or Data Ambassadors program. The list also provides a way for us to advertise events such as the Data Science Speaker Series and reunion happy hours.
