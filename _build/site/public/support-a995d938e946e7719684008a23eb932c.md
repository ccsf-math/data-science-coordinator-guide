# Support

## Responsibility
The Data Science coordinator organizes specific tutoring opportunities for MATH 108 students. Since MATH 108 is such a new course, we usually need to provide additional support for our tutors and establish alternative tutoring opportunities in order to provide a similar level of tutoring for our MATH 108 students that the rest of our students in the Department experience.

## Overview
We believe that a key feature of Berkeley's success with DATA 8 was the extensive support system for their students. Every since the beginning of MATH 108, we've tried to build up a support network for the course. 

### Math Lab Tutors

### Data Ambassadors
Through a Learning Grant, we have supported remote tutoring and mentoring through our Data Ambassadors program. The program originally featured UC Berkeley students who where seeking a Data Science degree and were former Community College students. These students offered virtual homework support and mentorship. Over the years, we have worked to include CCSF students as Data Ambassadors.
