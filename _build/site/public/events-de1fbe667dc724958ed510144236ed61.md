## Overview
Over the past few years, we have hosted several speakers to share their data-related work with students and the broader CCSF community. These talks are designed to give attendees insight into how data is used across various industries.

The format has been virtual, with each speaker joining via Zoom to give a ~30-minute talk about their background and current work. Each event concludes with a Q&A session. Recordings of these events are available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fu1vBo0HR3Y&list=PLDHNuYFn2lPMa-arWNI5XIONq2i-JfWN-).

As of Fall 2025, we’ve received new funding to support a general Mathematics Speaker Series.

## General Tasks
The Data Science Coordinator should help seek out and recommend potential speakers for this series to the Department Chair or to the faculty member overseeing the Speaker Series.
