## Overview
Weâ€™ve been collaborating with {term}`Emily Burns` in [Career Services](https://www.ccsf.edu/academics/career-education/career-services-office) to connect our students with internships and employment opportunities in data-related fields. One of our goals is to establish (micro) internships for students who complete MATH 108, the Data Analytics Certificate, or the Data Science AS degree, in order to strengthen the practical value of these programs. {term}`Emily <Emily Burns>` regularly shares curated resources and opportunities with us via email. We made some progress with SFMTA to try and establish an internship that would connect with our MATH 108 course, but that develop stopped when our main contact at SFMTA took on a new role.
